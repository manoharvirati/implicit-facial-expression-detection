# projectcv
- Facial Expression Detection using openCV and Tensorflow (Keras)
- This repository Contains the Python Source Code, Documentation and Support files for the Facial Emotion Recognition CNN.

- The Dataset directory is supposed to contain the CK+ Dataset. To use a different dataset, the ckpluslayer.py module found in the Code directory may need to be modified.
- The Emotion Dataset directory is the location where the code is configured to store processed data from the CK+ Dataset.
- The project can be run through the gui.py module.
- All path variable are specified within the different modules. 
- Therefore to use different paths, the path variables in each module must be modified.

- The Support directory contains a pre-trained CNN and the file required for the LBP Cascade Classifier.
